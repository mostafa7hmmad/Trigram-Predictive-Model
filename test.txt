analysis. Furthermore, 16% of the selected research articles entirely automate the trading process. In addition, 
we identified 40 different AI techniques that are used as standalone and hybrid models. Among these techniques, 
deep learning techniques are the most frequently used in financial trading markets. Building prediction models 
for financial markets using AI is a promising field of research, and academics have already deployed several 
machine learning models. As a result of this evaluation, we provide recommendations and guidance to
