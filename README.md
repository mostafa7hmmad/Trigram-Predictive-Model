# Trigram-Model
This project showcases a trigram-based language model using Python libraries like collections and math. It features autocomplete functionality and perplexity calculations for sequences of three words. A user-friendly interface, built with Streamlit, allows users to input two words and receive a prediction for the third. This project highlights the practical application of n-gram models in natural language processing." Does that fit your project?
